'''The Python code provided defines a class named CustomSudoku that can be used to create and solve custom 
Sudoku puzzles. The class generates a random Sudoku puzzle with a given number of missing digits. By entering 
values in diagonal boxes and then retracing to solve the puzzle, it assures a valid initial state. The code 
also offers methods for printing the Sudoku grid and solving the puzzle by backtracking. The main programme 
initialises a CustomSudoku instance, produces and fills a Sudoku puzzle, prints the initial puzzle, solves it, 
and prints the finished Sudoku grid. Overall, the code provides a Sudoku puzzle creation and solving tool with
a graphical user interface.'''
